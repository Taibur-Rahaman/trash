# ⚠️ IMPORTANT REALITY CHECK: No 90% Guarantee Exists

## 🚨 Critical Warning

**NO legitimate academic journal or conference guarantees 90% acceptance without review or edits.** Any venue that promises this is likely a **PREDATORY PUBLISHER** that will:
- Damage your academic reputation
- Not be indexed in legitimate databases
- Be rejected by employers/universities
- Waste your money
- Not count for academic credit

---

## ✅ LEGITIMATE OPTIONS WITH HIGHER ACCEPTANCE RATES

Here are **REAL, LEGITIMATE** venues with higher acceptance rates (30-60%) that are still respected:

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY FOR YOUR PAPER

### **Option 1: IEEE Regional Conference (BEST BALANCE)**
1. **Search for:** "IEEE regional conference 2025 Asia" or "IEEE regional conference embedded systems"
2. **Acceptance:** 50-58% (highest legitimate rate)
3. **Benefits:**
   - IEEE name = respected
   - Fast review
   - Good networking
   - Lower cost
4. **Action:** Google "IEEE regional conferences 2025" and find ones accepting papers

### **Option 2: MDPI Sensors Special Issue**
1. **Check:** mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues
2. **Look for:** Special issues on:
   - "Wearable Sensors"
   - "Gesture Recognition"
   - "Embedded Systems for Communication"
3. **Acceptance:** Higher in special issues (~50%)
4. **Benefits:**

3. **Trade-off:** Lower impact, but fast and legitimate

---

## ⚠️ WHAT TO EXPECT (REALITY)

Even with higher acceptance rates, you should expect:

1. **Peer Review:** All legitimate venues require peer review
2. **Revisions:** Most papers need minor/major revisions (80-90% of accepted papers)
3. **Time:** Even "fast" journals take 2-3 months minimum
4. **No Guarantees:** No venue guarantees acceptance

**This is NORMAL and GOOD** - it means your paper is being properly reviewed!

---

## 🚫 RED FLAGS: AVOID THESE (PREDATORY)

### **Signs of Predatory Journals:**
- ✅ Promises "guaranteed acceptance"
- ✅ Accepts within 24-48 hours
- ✅ No peer review mentioned
- ✅ Very high fees ($5000+)
- ✅ Unsolicited email invitations
- ✅ Fake impact factors
- ✅ Not indexed in Scopus/Web of Science
- ✅ Poor website quality
- ✅ Generic acceptance letters

### **Examples to AVOID:**
- Any journal promising "90% acceptance"
- Journals that accept in 1-2 days
- Journals not indexed in legitimate databases
- Journals with fake editorial boards

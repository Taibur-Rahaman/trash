## CHAPTER 1

### INTRODUCTION

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used in various applications such as surveying, inspection, monitoring, and data collection. Behind the operation of these systems lies a combination of hardware components and software platforms that ensure stable communication, control, and data processing.

Software engineering plays a vital role in UAV systems, particularly in areas such as ground control software, telemetry data handling, user interface design, and automation. The purpose of this internship was to gain practical exposure to these software-based aspects of drone systems and to understand how theoretical knowledge is applied in an industrial environment.

This internship allowed me to work in a professional setting where I could observe real software development workflows, collaborate with engineers, and contribute to ongoing projects related to drone software systems.

## CHAPTER 4

### METHODOLOGY AND WORK PROCESS

The internship followed a structured work process under the guidance of senior engineers. Initially, I was introduced to the internal software systems used by FlyMek for drone testing and monitoring. This included understanding how different software components interact with drone hardware and communication modules.

I assisted in maintaining and improving internal software tools by fixing minor issues, supporting feature updates, and testing system behavior. I also supported the integration of communication protocols such as MAVLink by observing how telemetry data is received, processed, and displayed in ground control applications.

Another part of my work involved supporting UI/UX improvements for applications like QGroundControl and related dashboards. This included improving layout clarity, ensuring better data visualization, and testing interface responsiveness.

Automation and real-time data monitoring were also part of my responsibilities. I assisted in tasks related to data logging, monitoring system performance, and verifying that real-time data streams were functioning correctly.

## CHAPTER 5

### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

During the internship, I worked with the following tools and technologies:

- Internal software systems for drone testing and monitoring
- MAVLink-based communication frameworks (support and integration)
- Ground control software such as QGroundControl
- Automation scripts for data processing and monitoring
- Documentation tools for recording technical progress

## CHAPTER 6

### RESULTS, ANALYSIS, AND DISCUSSION (EXPANDED)

During the internship period, several outcomes were observed as a result of my involvement in software-related tasks at FlyMek Drone Manufacturing. One of the key results was a clearer understanding of how internal software systems support drone testing, monitoring, and control operations. Through continuous exposure to these systems, I was able to observe how telemetry data is collected, transmitted, processed, and displayed within ground control software.

While assisting in MAVLink-based communication support, I analyzed how telemetry messages are received by ground control applications and how communication delays or inconsistencies can affect data reliability. Although I did not modify core protocol implementations, observing these behaviors helped me understand the importance of synchronization, data consistency, and proper system configuration in UAV software systems.

Another important result of my internship was the improvement of user interface clarity in ground control and dashboard applications. By supporting UI/UX enhancements, I observed how changes in layout, grouping of data fields, and visual prioritization can significantly improve operator understanding. These improvements reduce confusion during monitoring and help operators respond more effectively during testing sessions.

In addition, my involvement in automation and real-time data monitoring tasks highlighted the importance of accurate data logging and performance tracking. Even small inconsistencies in data handling were found to have noticeable effects on system evaluation. Overall, the internship demonstrated that reliable drone operation depends heavily on well-maintained software systems, even when working with internal tools rather than production-level applications.

## CHAPTER 7

### LEARNING OUTCOMES (EXPANDED)

The internship provided substantial learning outcomes across technical, professional, and personal dimensions. From a technical perspective, I gained practical exposure to software engineering concepts that are difficult to fully understand through coursework alone. Concepts such as telemetry data handling, real-time system monitoring, and software–hardware interaction became clearer through hands-on observation and assisted implementation.

I developed a better understanding of how communication protocols like MAVLink are used in practice, particularly in the context of ground control software. Observing real telemetry streams helped me connect theoretical ideas such as latency, packet consistency, and data synchronization with real system behavior.

Professionally, the internship improved my ability to work in a team-based engineering environment. I learned how to communicate technical issues clearly, follow instructions from senior engineers, and document progress in a structured manner. These skills are essential for working effectively in professional software development settings.

On a personal level, the internship increased my confidence in applying academic knowledge to real-world problems. It also helped me understand workplace discipline, responsibility, and the importance of meeting deadlines and maintaining professional conduct.

## CHAPTER 8

### CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS (EXPANDED)

One of the primary challenges during the internship was adapting to complex existing software systems within a limited time frame. Since these systems were already in use, understanding their structure and behavior required careful observation and guidance from experienced engineers.

Working with real-time telemetry data also presented challenges, as system behavior could vary depending on environmental conditions, system load, or hardware configuration. This made it difficult to reproduce certain issues consistently, requiring patience and careful analysis rather than immediate conclusions.

Another limitation was restricted access to certain system components due to operational and security considerations. As an intern, my role was limited to assisting and supporting tasks rather than making major architectural changes. However, this limitation provided valuable insight into professional boundaries, version control practices, and collaborative workflows used in industry.

Despite these challenges, the internship provided meaningful learning opportunities and exposed me to real-world engineering constraints that are rarely encountered in academic environments.
